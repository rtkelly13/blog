# Reviving My Blog: A Three-Part Series

I revived my 3-year-dormant blog by combining a complete technical stack upgrade (React 17→19, Tailwind 3→4, Webpack→Turbopack) with a full design transformation to a retro-brutalist terminal aesthetic—all with AI assistance.

This series covers the entire journey from discovering AI-assisted development to implementing a complete design system.

## Part 1: Discovering AI-Assisted Development

The story of how I discovered OpenCode and Gemini CLI for code assistance, and my first experiments with AI helping me tackle 3 years of accumulated technical debt.

**Topics covered:**

- The dormant project problem (3 years of dependency drift)
- First experiments with OpenCode
- The AI workflow that clicked
- What AI was good/bad at
- Key lessons from week 1

## Part 2: Upgrading Dependencies and Tools

The technical journey of upgrading React, Next.js, Tailwind, switching build tools, and adding quality infrastructure—all with step-by-step AI assistance.

**Topics covered:**

- Foundation upgrades (npm→pnpm, ESLint+Prettier→Biome, CommonJS→ESM)
- Core dependency upgrades (React 17→19, Next.js 13→16, Tailwind 3→4)
- Quality infrastructure (Playwright tests, CI/CD with GitHub Actions)
- Bug fixes discovered along the way
- What AI was good/bad at for technical migrations

## Part 3: Design System Implementation

A deep dive into the retro-brutalist design system: color palettes, typography stacks, brutalist UI components, ASCII art integration, performance results, and design lessons learned.

**Topics covered:**

- Complete design system breakdown (colors, typography, spacing)
- Brutalist UI component patterns (buttons, cards, navigation)
- ASCII art integration and Mermaid diagram theming
- Performance optimization results
- What AI was good/bad at for design work
- Design system maintenance guidelines
