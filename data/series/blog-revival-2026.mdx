This series documents the complete revival of a 3-year-old Next.js blog that had been gathering dust since 2021.

## What You'll Learn

- **AI-Assisted Development**: How I leveraged AI tools (Cursor, Windsurf) to accelerate development
- **Major Framework Upgrades**: React 17 → 19, Next.js 13 → 16, Tailwind 3 → 4
- **Build Tool Migration**: Webpack → Turbopack for faster builds
- **Design System**: From minimal academic to retro-brutalist terminal aesthetic
- **Modern Best Practices**: Testing, CI/CD, and development workflows

## The Journey

This wasn't just a simple upgrade—it was a complete transformation of a dormant project into a modern, maintainable blog with a unique visual identity.

### Key Challenges

- Breaking changes across multiple major versions
- Tailwind CSS v4's complete rewrite of the plugin system
- Balancing aesthetics with accessibility
- Implementing visual regression testing for design consistency

### What Makes This Series Different

Rather than just showing the final result, I'm documenting the entire process: the dead ends, the discoveries, the AI-assisted breakthroughs, and the design decisions that shaped the final product.
